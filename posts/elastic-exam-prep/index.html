It's an hour long so get comfortable.</p><h2>Read the FAQ</h2><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/training/certification/faq">https://www.elastic.co/training/certification/faq</a></p><p>This FAQ has a lot of logistical information regarding the exam.</p><h2>Register for the classes</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/training/elasticsearch-engineer-1">Engineer 1</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/training/elasticsearch-engineer-2">Engineer 2</a></li></ul><p>These aren't cheap but they <em>are</em> worth it, even if you already have a lot of experience with Elasticsearch. Get your employer to pay for it.</p><h3>Scheduling</h3><p>If you plan to register for Engineer 2 after you complete Engineer 1, you may find that your ideal Engineer 2 offering has filled up and you'll be stuck taking it at an inconvenient time.</p><p>Register for both classes up front.</p><h2>Before class</h2><p>Copy and paste the <a href="https://training.elastic.co/exam/elastic-certified-engineer#objectives">exam objectives outline</a> into a markdown file.</p><p>Get familiar with what topics are listed here.</p><h2>During class</h2><p>Take notes directly into your objectives outline.</p><p>The classes don't follow the order of the outline but luckily you familiarized yourself with the outline beforehand so it's easy to jump around.</p><h2>After class</h2><h3>Finalize your outline</h3><p>Go through your outline notes and use the class slides or <a href="https://www.elastic.co/docs">Elastic docs</a> to fill any gaps.</p><p>Be sure to switch the dropdown in the docs to the Elasticsearch version that the exam covers.</p><h3>Practice</h3><p>Install Elasticsearch locally, create some indices and work through some of the labs from class. Use the outline as a guide for choosing what to practice.</p><h2>Day before the exam</h2><p>Watch the video again. Seriously.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzo_uR3IsbQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzo_uR3IsbQ</a></p><p>It's like repeat viewings of a good movie. You'll pick up on stuff you missed the first time through.</p><h2>During the exam: don't panic</h2><p>The video reminds you not to panic during the exam. This is important.</p><p>The test environment will get buggy. Your connection will get laggy. You will get stuck on a question.</p><p>You need to stay composed and keep moving forward through the exam problems.</p><h2>After the exam: exhale</h2><p>Sit back, relax and wait for that congrats email :)</p></section></article></div></main><footer class="p-8 text-center text-sm border-t-2 border-gray-200"><span>Â©2019 Paul Salaets</span><br><span>Built with <a href="https://www.11ty.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-700 underline">Eleventy</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-700 underline">Tailwind CSS</a></span></footer></body></html>
